Completed hands-on offensive security training focused on real-world attack simulations and penetration testing methodologies across multiple systems and networks.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Reconnaissance & Scanning

-Performed OSINT investigations and active/passive scanning using Nmap, Gobuster, and Recon-ng

-Identified open ports, services, and vulnerabilities for exploitation planning

-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation

-Exploited misconfigured services (e.g., SMB, FTP, web servers) in lab environments

-Gained shell access using tools like Metasploit, Netcat, and custom payloads

-Escalated privileges on both Windows and Linux using local enumeration and common misconfigurations

-Password Attacks & Cracking

-Conducted brute-force and dictionary attacks using Hydra, John the Ripper, and Hashcat

-Captured and cracked password hashes from compromised systems

-Post-Exploitation & Persistence

-Created reverse shells and persistence mechanisms to maintain access

-Exfiltrated data and simulated lateral movement techniques

-Web Application Testing

-Performed SQL injection, XSS, and directory traversal on vulnerable web apps

-Used Burp Suite to intercept, manipulate, and exploit web traffic

### Tools Used
